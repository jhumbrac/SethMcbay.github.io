		<h2>Mental Health</h2>
		<p>A mental illness is a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling or mood. Such conditions may affect someone's ability to relate to others and function each day. Each person will have different experiences, even people with the same diagnosis.</p>
		<p>Recovery, including meaningful roles in social life, school and work, is possible, especially when you start treatment early and play a strong role in your own recovery process.</p>
		<p>A mental health condition isn’t the result of one event. Research suggests multiple, linking causes. Genetics, environment and lifestyle influence whether someone develops a mental health condition. A stressful job or home life makes some people more susceptible, as do traumatic life events like being the victim of a crime. Biochemical processes and circuits and basic brain structure may play a role, too.</p>
		<p>Our office is a multidisciplinary mental health practice that seeks to meet your individual needs. We currently have multiple Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Nurse Practitioners, Physician’s Assistants, Licensed Practical Counselors and Social Workers available that work together, in a team approach, to meet your therapeutic goals. As our name implies, We continuously strive to make each visit a satisfying experience. Please feel free to contact a member of our staff regarding your experience at any time.</p>
